Description: The Port Scan Attack Detector
 PSAD is a collection of four lightweight system daemons written in 
 Perl and in C that is designed to work with Linux firewalling code
 (iptables in the 2.4.x kernels, and ipchains in the 2.2.x kernels)
 to detect port scans. It features a set of highly configurable danger
 thresholds (with sensible defaults provided), verbose alert messages
 that include the source, destination, scanned port range, begin and 
 end times, tcp flags and corresponding nmap options (Linux 2.4.x 
 kernels only), reverse DNS info, email alerting, and automatic 
 blocking of offending ip addresses via dynamic configuration of 
 ipchains/iptables firewall rulesets.  
 .
 In addition, for the 2.4.x kernels psad incorporates many
 of the tcp signatures included in Snort to detect highly suspect scans
 for:
 .
  * various backdoor programs (e.g. EvilFTP, GirlFriend, SubSeven)
  * DDoS tools (mstream, shaft)
  * advanced port scans (syn, fin, xmas) such as those made with nmap
 .
