psad (2.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Snort rules are not bundled anymore in the package.
    Therefore you may want to install Fwsnort (suggested package) to handle
    your iptables ruleset according to the Snort rules, and update the Psad
    configuration to point to the directory where you keep them 
    (SNORT_RULE_DL_FILE variable in psad.conf).
  * The HOSTNAME variable in psad.conf is now set automatically during the
    install process.
