psad (2.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  It is now possible to pass arguments to psad through the /etc/default/psad
  file. It makes possible to handle override files, and thus keep your
  settings in a dedicated directory without having to recheck them after
  each upgrade of psad.

psad (2.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The Snort rules are not bundled anymore in the package.
  Therefore you may want to install Fwsnort (suggested package) to handle
  your iptables ruleset according to the Snort rules, and update the Psad
  configuration to point to the directory where you keep them 
  (SNORT_RULE_DL_FILE variable in psad.conf).
  
  The HOSTNAME variable in psad.conf is now set automatically during the
  install process.
