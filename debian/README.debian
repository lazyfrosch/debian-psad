auto_dl

If you are using free services like proxyscan.freenode.net
to test your network config you can let psad ignore this scans by
uncommenting the line in /etc/psad/auto_dl.

TODO

- needs probably configuration (with debconf?) to work properly
- check if it works with Bastille (also any new versions)
