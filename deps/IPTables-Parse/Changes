Revision history for Perl extension IPTables::Parse.

1.1 Fri Mar 02 22:31:12 2012
    - Minor update to print the iptables binary name in 'croak' error
      conditions.  The binary name is either 'iptables' or 'ip6tables'.
    - Minor perldoc updates to render links better (two spaces at the beginning
      of lines).

1.0 Tue Feb 28 21:45:19 2012
    - Added META.{yml,json} files to fix this bug:
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75366
    - Added the ability to specify 'ip6tables' when instantiating an
      IPTables::ChainMgr object via 'new'.
    - Updated license to the Artistic license.

0.9 Sun Feb 26 21:01:45 2012
    - Applied slightly modified patch from SSIMON to properly pick up usage of
      state tracking in rule extended information as shown in this bug:
            https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=67372#txn-925687
      Rule 'extended' hash now includes the 'state' or 'ctstate' key
      depending on which iptables state tracking module is being used (if
      any).

0.8 Sun Feb 26 14:03:24 2012
    - Major update to support ip6tables policies.
    - Added test suite script t/basic_tests.pl to exercise major functions for
      both iptables and ip6tables.
    - Bugfix for default_log() and default_drop() functions to ensure that
      a proper return value is given in addition to the return of a results
      hash.
    - Migrated to git for source control:

0.7 Fri Oct 17 11:55:01 2008
    - Completely re-worked the manner in which iptables commands are executed
      so that they are sent through a single function with various options
      (described below) for controlling execution.
    - Added the ability to control iptables execution model.  The default is to
      use waitpid(), but other options are to use system() or popen().
    - Added the ability to introduce a configurable time delay between each
      iptables command.
    - Added the ability to use a function reference for the SIGCHLD signal
      handler.
    - Added the ability to configure the number of seconds used as the alarm
      timeout for iptables command execution in the waitpid() execution model.
