Revision history for Perl extension IPTables::ChainMgr.

1.2 Fri Mar 02 21:09:57 2012
    - Added set_chain_policy() function to allow built-in chain policies to be
      set to the specified target.  iptables/ip6tables does not allow the
      target to be set for non built-in chains.  Behind the scenes this
      function runs the command "iptables -t <table> -P <chain> <target>".
    - Minor update to print the iptables binary name in 'croak' error
      conditions.  The binary name is either 'iptables' or 'ip6tables'.
    - Minor perldoc updates to render links better (two spaces at the beginning
      of lines).

1.1 Tue Feb 28 21:15:11 2012
    - Added META.{yml,json} files similarly to fixing this bug filed against
      IPTables::Parse:
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75366
    - Minor bug fix to ensure not to look for 'extended' hash keys in returned
      IPTables::Parse data without an existence check first.
    - Added the ability to specify 'ip6tables' when instantiating an
      IPTables::ChainMgr object via 'new'.
    - Updated license to the Artistic license.

1.0 Mon Feb 27 21:56:44 2012
    - Added 'ctstate' and 'state' keys to extended hashes for find_ip_rule()
      and add_ip_rule().  This commit fixes:
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=67614
    - Bug fix for missing IPTables::Parse dependency by applying patch from the
      CPAN bug tracking system here:
        https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43302

0.9.9 Sun Feb 26 14:03:24 2012
    - Updated to handle IPv6 via ip6tables.  All functions in the previous
      version of this module now work with ip6tables - just instantiate the
      IPTables::ChainMgr object with something like the following:

        my %opts = (
            'iptables' => $ip6tables_bin,
            'iptout'   => '/tmp/ip6tables.out',
            'ipterr'   => '/tmp/ip6tables.err',
            'debug'    => 0,
            'verbose'  => 0
        );

    - Switched to using NetAddr::IP instead of the old Net::IPv4Addr module.
      This greatly assisted in the ability to offer IPv6 support via ip6tables.
    - Bug fix to ensure proper handling of empty 'extended' hashes via the
      'keys' function.
    - (Miloslav Trmac) Bug fix for "Use of qw(...) as parentheses is
      deprecated" warnings as described here:
            https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=771781
    - Added a test suite at: t/basic_tests.pl
    - Migrated to git for source control:

            https://github.com/mrash/IPTables-ChainMgr

0.9 Sat Feb 11 23:11:45 2008
    - Added Net::IPv4Addr prerequisite to Makefile.PL (patch submitted by
      Dominik Gehl).
    - Updated perldoc documentation to properly discuss the delete_chain()
      API.  The material about the $jump_from_chain was missing (Darien
      Kindlund reported this issue).
    - Applied patch from Darien Kindlund to add the ability to specify the
      source MAC address via the --mac-source <addr> command line argument to
      iptables.

0.8 Fri Oct 17 11:35:15 2008
    - Added the ability to control the iptables execution model.  The default
      is to use waitpid(), but other options are to use system() or popen().
    - Added the ability to introduce a configurable time delay between each
      iptables command.
    - Added the ability to use a function reference for the SIGCHLD signal
      handler.
    - Added the ability to configure the number of seconds used as the alarm
      timeout for iptables command execution in the waitpid() execution model.
    - Passed IPTables::ChainMgr options for execution model, configurable alarm
      timeouts, the SIGCHLD signal handler reference, and the configurable
      number of seconds for additional sleeps between iptables commands to the
      IPTables::Parse module.
    - Bugfix for SIGALRM handling to be more consistent with an example from
      the perlipc man page.
    - Added append_ip_rule() so that new iptables rules can be appended to the
      end of a chain instead of just inserted at a particular rule number.

0.7 Sat May 17 10:49:15 2008
    - Added perldoc documentation for 0.7 release.
